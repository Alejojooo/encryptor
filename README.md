## About The Project

![User interface](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78036094/211670078-8ce6c6e6-48b3-457e-bf64-08dd7d33ac95.png)

This project is part of ONE (Oracle Next Education) program, provided by Oracle in collaboration with Alura Latam.

The user enters the message to encrypt or decrypt, chooses said function and, immediately, the result is shown in the correspondent area.

The message can only contains lowercase letters without accents. If a message does not met this condition, an advice will shown in the output field.

### Encryption keys

Both encryption and decryption uses the same encrypt keys, shown below:

* The letter "a" is converted to "ai".
* The letter "e" is converted to "enter".
* The letter "i" is converted to "imes".
* The letter "o" is converted to "ober".
* The letter "u" is converted to "ufat".

Any letter that does not belong to an encryption key will remain unchanged.

### Other features

* Responsive design.
* Dark mode.
* Buttons to clean user input and copy result.
